## grepper
grepper is a python script that automates the process of finding interesting things like URLs, secrets, keys, etc and it also provides you the output in tabular form.

All regex mentioned in the script is from Tomnomnom gf tool (https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) and also from Ryan Wendel.a

Grepper is not a replacement for gf. In my case, I need the output in a different format. So I created grepper.
